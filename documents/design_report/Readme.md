# Usability Report Professor Comments

- **wireframes**: 
some terminological mistakes (e.g. in introductory pages, some structural links in introductory pages should be group links);
- missing orientation info (**NB we have written that the orientation info aren't completely implemented due to implementation issue, but we have specified how should be in the website**); 
- **web site**:
overall good but "back" link incorrect (e.g., back to all projects when the user is not coming from "All projects"; missing orientation info affects usability; in person page the fact that the image and its label refer to projects is unclear (missing lables)
